Graphtage
=========

Graphtage is *both* a commandline utility *and* a general purpose library for semantically comparing and merging
tree-like structures, such as JSON, XML, HTML, YAML, and CSV files. Its name is a portmanteau of “graph” and
“graftage”—the latter being the practice of joining two trees together such that they grow as one.

This documentation focuses on Graphtage’ use as a library, specifically how to extend it by implementing new file
formats. For instructions on using Graphtage as a utility, see the documentation in its `GitHub page`_.
